        Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox Layout Model
        <ol>
            <li>justify-content</li>
            <li>align-items</li>
            <li>gap</li>
            <li>flex-direction</li>
            <li>flex-wrap</li>
        </ol>
    </h2>
    <h2>Solution:</h2>

        <li><strong>justify-content:</strong></li>
        <p>
            The justify-content property in Flexbox is used to control the alignment of flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It determines how the extra space or insufficient space along the main axis is distributed. There are several values for justify-content, including flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-evenly and space-around. For example, if you set justify-content: center;, flex items will be centered along the main axis of the container. If you set justify-content: space-between;, the first item will be aligned to the start, the last item to the end, and the remaining space will be distributed evenly between the items
        </p>
        <li><strong>align-items:</strong></li>
        <p>
            The align-items property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis of the flex container. It specifies how items are positioned within their container along this axis. It accepts values such as flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch. For instance, if you set align-items: center, flex items will be vertically centered within the container. If you set align-items: stretch;, items will expand to fill the entire cross-axis space of the container, ensuring they have the same height.
        </p>
        <li><strong>gap:</strong></li>
        <p>
            The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout.
        <li><strong>flex-direction:</strong></li>
        <p>
            The flex-direction property determines the direction in which flex items are placed within the flex container. It defines the main aixs and consequently, the layout flow. It can have values such as row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse. 
        </p>
        <li><strong>flex-wrap:</strong></li>
        <p>
            The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are allowed to wrap onto multiple lines (new rows or columns) within the flex container when they don't fit along the main axis. It accepts values like nowrap, wrap and wrap-reverse. For instance, if you set flex-wrap;, wrap;, flex items will wrap to the next line when there's not enough space on the current line, creating a multi-line layout. flex-wrap is useful for accomadating vaious screen sizes and orientations, allowing items to adapt to different viewports and preventing content from getting cut off.  
        </p>
    </ol>
    
    These properties play a critical role in creating well-structured and visually pleasing layouts in Flexbox, allowing you to control the positioning, allignment, and spacing of flex within a container.
