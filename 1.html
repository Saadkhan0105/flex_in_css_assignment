    <title>Differnce between Flex Layout and Grid Layout</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Explain the main differnece between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use over the others?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> The key differnece between the Flexbox and CSS Grid layout models lies in their layout strategies and how they handle the arrangement of elements:
        <br>
        <strong>Flexbox</strong> is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on distributing space and aligning items along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It's best suited for layouts where you have a row or column of items, such as navigation menus, card-based designs, or centering content within a container.
        <br>
        <strong>CSS Grid</strong> is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns. It creates a grid of cells where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells. CSS Grid is ideal for complex grid-based design like magazine layouts, forms, and any layout where content needs to be placed in a precise grid structure. 

        Choosing between Flexbox and CSS Grid depends on your soecific layout requirements.
        <br>

        You might choose <strong>Flexbox</strong> when you need to arrange items alone a single axis, for example, when creating navigation bars, header/ footer layouts, or aligning elements within a container. Flexbox is great for responsive designs where items can vary in size.
        <br>

        You might choose <strong>CSS Grid</strong>  when you need to create more complex, two dimensional layouts with rows and columns. It's particularly useful when you have a grid-like structure, such as galleries, forms with multiples fields, or any design that requires precise control  over both rows and columns.
        <br>
        
        In some cases, you may even combine both <strong>Flexbox and CSS Grid</strong> within a single layout to leverage the strengths of each model for different  parts of your webpage.
